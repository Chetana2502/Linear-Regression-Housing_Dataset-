Linear Regression on Housing Dataset:

Overview: 
This project implements linear regression on a housing dataset to predict house prices based on various features. The analysis includes both simple and multiple linear regression approaches, along with comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualizations to interpret the results.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this analysis is a housing dataset containing information about various properties and their prices. The features include property characteristics such as area, bathrooms, bedrooms, and other relevant attributes that may influence property values.

Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

Steps Performed
1. Data Loading and Exploration - Loaded the housing dataset and performed initial exploration.
2. Data Preprocessing - Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately. Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding. Normalized numerical features when necessary.
3. Model Implementation - Split data into training and testing sets. Implemented simple linear regression with one feature. Implemented multiple linear regression with multiple features.
4. Model Evaluation - Calculated Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R^(2) Score. Visualized the regression line against actual data points.
5. Coefficient Interpretation - Analyzed the meaning of model coefficients in the context of house prediction.

Insights:
- The analysis revealed significant correlations between certain housing features and property prices.
- The multiple regression model provided better predictive performance than simple regression.
- R^(2) score indicated how much variance in house prices is explained by the model.
- Certain features had more impact on price prediction, as evidenced by their coefficients.

Conclusion:
This linear regression implementation demonstrates fundamental regression concepts and provides a solid foundation for predicting house prices. The model evaluations offer insights into the accuracy of predictions and highlight the importance of various features in determining property values.

How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn).
2. Download the Housing dataset and place it the same directory as the Python script.
3. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook to execute the analysis and view the results.
